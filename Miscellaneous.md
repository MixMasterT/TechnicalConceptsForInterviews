Generally, Internet is a powerful cyber-world, with that you can not only send electronic mails to your friend who live hundreds of miles away in just a tiny fraction of time, but you can also do a lot of magical things with that like create your own place and connect with people around the world by sharing your opinions, your own writings, the music you like or the movie you’ve watched. You can stay at home and still be able to connect to millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies.
